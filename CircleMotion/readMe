App description
When the user places one finger on the screen a circle is drawn on the screen. The center of
the circle is placed where the user touched the screen. The circle can be the color of your
choice. The circle can be solid or not, again your choice. The longer the finger is pressed the
bigger the circle becomes. The user can put multiple circles on the screen by touching it multiple
times. You should be able to support up to 15 different circles on the screen at a time.
The drawing area for the circles will be the entire screen. You can keep the title bar at the top
of the screen if you like. There is no need for menus or instructions on how to use the app.
The user can set a circle in motion by placing a finger on a circle and swiping in any direction.
The circles will start moving in direction and velocity indicated by the swipe. Different circles
can be moving in different directions with different speeds.
